Certainly! Password entropy is a representation of how unpredictable a password is, typically measured in bits. The higher the entropy, the harder the password is to crack. Here's an in-depth explanation of the different ways to compute password entropy:

### 1. **Brute Force Entropy**:
This is the simplest form of entropy calculation. It's based on the number of possible characters in the password and the length of the password.

**Formula**: 
$$ E = \log_2(N^L) $$
Where:
- \( E \) = Entropy (in bits)
- \( N \) = Number of possible characters
- \( L \) = Length of the password

For example, for a password of length 8 using only lowercase letters:
$$ E = \log_2(26^8) $$

### 2. **Dictionary Attack Entropy**:
This method considers that attackers might use a list of common words or passwords (a dictionary) to guess the password.

**Formula**:
$$ E = \log_2(D) $$
Where:
- \( E \) = Entropy (in bits)
- \( D \) = Number of words in the dictionary

If an attacker is using a dictionary of 1 million common passwords, then:
$$ E = \log_2(1,000,000) $$

### 3. **Hybrid Attack Entropy**:
This method combines brute force and dictionary attacks. The attacker might use a dictionary but also append or prepend numbers or symbols to each word.

The entropy is calculated based on the dictionary size and the additional combinations from the appended or prepended characters.

### 4. **First-letter Uppercase Entropy**:
Many people capitalize the first letter of a word in their password. If we assume that an attacker knows this, the entropy of the first character is reduced.

**Formula**:
$$ E = \log_2(N) + (L-1) \times \log_2(M) $$
Where:
- \( E \) = Entropy (in bits)
- \( N \) = Number of uppercase letters (usually 26)
- \( L \) = Length of the password
- \( M \) = Number of possible characters for the other positions

### 5. **Known Pattern Entropy**:
If an attacker knows that a password follows a specific pattern (e.g., "word-digit-symbol"), they can reduce their search space. The entropy is calculated based on the possible combinations for each segment of the pattern.

### 6. **Two-word Combination Entropy**:
Some users combine two words to create a password. If an attacker knows this, they might use a dictionary of common words and try combinations.

**Formula**:
$$ E = \log_2(D^2) $$
Where:
- \( E \) = Entropy (in bits)
- \( D \) = Number of words in the dictionary

### 7. **Personal Information Entropy**:
If an attacker has personal information about a user (e.g., date of birth, name, etc.), they might try combinations of this information. The entropy is reduced based on the amount and type of known information.

### 8. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) Entropy**:
When MFA is used, an attacker needs to bypass multiple layers of security. The total entropy is the sum of the entropy of each factor.

### Tips to Increase Password Entropy:
1. **Increase Length**: Longer passwords generally have higher entropy.
2. **Use a Mix of Characters**: Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
3. **Avoid Common Words**: Dictionary attacks target common words and phrases.
4. **Use Random Generation**: Use password managers or generators to create random passwords.
5. **Regularly Change Passwords**: This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker.
6. **Use Multi-factor Authentication**: This adds an additional layer of security.

Remember, while entropy is a useful measure of password strength, it's just one aspect of password security. Other factors, such as the security of the system storing the passwords and the methods used by attackers, also play crucial roles.
